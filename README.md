- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chuck-Rittersdorf

- 👀 I’m interested in building a website and learning Javascript (+html/css) along the way.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript on an intermediate(?) level.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that turn musical files (midi, xml etc) into a playable score in a browser.

- 📫 How to reach me: leave me a word on Github and I'll get in touch.
